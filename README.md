When running simplecov, you will notice that the test case coverage as 
printed out on the terminal for each sepearte file is below 90%. This is wrong. 
If you take a look at index.html in the coverage folder that will get generated, 
you will find that the file that you are testing for has a coverage of well over 
90% so please make sure to check that when running these test files. If you run 
into any problems, please let me know. Thanks!
